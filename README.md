#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is designing and developing digital systems or programs to ensure they work well and function properly.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Waterfall method-It introduced a structured approach where each phase of the software development flows downwards like a waterfall.
Agile Manifesto-It focuses on individuals and interactions over process and tools,working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation and responding to change over folllowing a plan
DevOps-It bridges the gap between development(Dev) and ooerations(Ops) team which has greatly influenced the way software is developed leading to more efficient, collaborative and customer-centric approach in the field of software enginnering.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
A.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall metholodogy, the development process is linear and consequential with each phase dependent on the deliverables of the previous one,its moree suitable for projects that involve a physical infrastucture such as a bridge.
On the other hand, Agile is an iterative and incremental approach where the project is divided into small sprints allowing for flexibility and adaptability to changes it is often more succesful for startup projects with unclear or evolving specifications


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
In a software engineering team, a software developer is responsible for coding and building the software ensuring it meets the project requirements.
The quality assurance engineer tests the software for bugs and ensures its quality before release.
The project manager oversees the project, managing resources, timelines and communication to ensure successful delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environment are all in one toolkit for software developers that provide code editing,debugging and project management i.e Visual Studio
Version Control Systems are crucial for tracking changes in code, collaborating with team members and reverting to previous versions if needed i.e GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines which can be overcome by prioritizing tasks and staying organized.
Changing Requirements to tackle this communication should be done effectively so as to meet requirements.
Complex technical issues to tackle this software engineers should continously enhance technical skills through learning and practice.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT testing-focuses on testing units of code in isolation.Unit testing is important as it helos catch bugs early in the development process and promotes code quality and maintainability.
INTERGRATION testing-verifies that diferent units of codework together correctly.It plays a key role in detecting interface defects and ensuring the proper functioning of the software.
SYSTEM testing-evaluates the behaviour of a fully intergrated software product.It's essential for validating the software readiness for release and identifying any discrepancies between the system and user expectations.
AACEPTANCE testing-Involves testing the software in the real world scenario to determine if it satisfies the acceptance criteria set by the stakeholders.It's crucial for gaining confidence in the software usability and confirming that it aligns  with user's expectations.




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is creating software solutions to meet specific needs ,focusing on speed and efficiency.
Prompt Engineering is important when working with AI modlel because it helps in quickly creating effective ways to communicate with the models, making interactions smooth and efficient.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example:''Explain things''
Improved Example:''Could you elaborate on a specific topic?"
The improved prompt is effective as it specifies the information being requested, making it easier to provide a relevant and precise response.
